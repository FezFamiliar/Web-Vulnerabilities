# Web-Vulnerabilities

In this repo I will try to cover everything about Web Vulnerabilities. There are other, **better** repos for this which covers **ALOT** of material but the main thing which is different in this repo is the fact that i try to explain things **as simply as possible** rather than overload you with a huge wall of text.

This repo is developed gradually, i will add things along the way. I am currently working on the hacker101.com CTFs.
